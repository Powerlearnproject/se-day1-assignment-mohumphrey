# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
it is a process of coming up with a software i.e systemic application of methods, tools and maintanance of high quality sofftware systems.
the main importance of software engineering is always to come up with applications that make are easy to navigate while a user finds what he/she needs answers to.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
planning

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
planning - this entails preparation towards the software one intends to develope
requirements - it entails putting into consideration and analyzing whatever the software will require to give out the intended  output
design - means how easy or flexible can one get around while using a given software developed.
coding - initial putting into action the idea in a machine language
testing - basically running it maybe in local servers to see if it meets the requirements.
deployment - having the software in the market for easy access
maintainance - constantly checking for bugs and any short comings

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
